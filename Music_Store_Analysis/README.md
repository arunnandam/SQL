# SQL Music Store Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a music store database using PostgreSQL. The database contains 11 tables, including information about artists, albums, tracks, genres, customers, invoices, and employees. Through this project, I aim to extract meaningful insights from the data to understand customer preferences, identify top-selling products, and evaluate sales performance.

We can answer many questions from the data such as 
1. Most popular music Genre for each country?
2. How much amount spent by each customer on artists?
3. What is the best genre and artist with most songs in that genre?
4. How much money customers are spending on music?
5. Which country spends the most amount on music?
